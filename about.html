                        At the forefront of the country x city connection, Organic is the first signature service for specialty coffees in the country. In 2012, when specialty coffee was destined for export, Organic was born as a manifesto for coffee from South America to the world, with the purpose of distributing the acclaimed best coffee in South America around the world.<br>
                        <br>

                        Rich in different terroirs, South America stands out for the wide range of possible flavors for the coffee bean. This abundance on the palate is due to the unique natural capacity that the continent has in its soil. This map of immense fruit and cultivation range makes the job of hunting the best coffees even more exciting and not monotonous, making the incessant search for distinct flavor profiles our great challenge. <br>
                        <br>

                        We have coffee hunters with a heightened sixth sense and we bring award-winning and certified coffees to our roasters.br>
                        <br>

                        Our roasting is handmade, in small quantities, to ensure that the coffee that arrives at your home is of high quality and always fresh.

                    We mine the best microlots of specialty coffees from each crop annually. We personally go to the farms to mine the coffees. This year we have more than thirty labels, from the most diverse Brazilian regions.<br>
                    <br>

                    Only in South America, with its reach nature, with a formidable amount of microclimates, added to high-level agriculture, we get coffees with the diversity and quality like no other place in the world. Being so close to this environment, it is natural to exchange experiences with producers to adjust processes and methods to obtain the coffees that connoisseurs are looking for. This exchange of experience that begins in the field, goes to the final consumer and returns to the farm, makes the ascending spiral of quality more and more intense.

                    For years we have lived intensely the exchange relationship with our customer friends. Through courses and workshops we transmit the concept of the world of specialty coffees. On the other hand, coffee lovers tell us their preferences and tell us about their experiences with coffees.<br>

                    Nós apertamos a mão de quem produz o teu café. Essa relação de olho no olho, como costumamos tratar na roça para confiança, vem de um princípio básico no Organic: caçamos, torramos e comercializamos café verídico.
